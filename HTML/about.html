          <span>History</span>
        </div>
        <p>We’re proudly upholding the values W.K. Kellogg instilled more than 100 years ago — but now we’re 
          doing it in 180 countries across the world including India and South Asia. We provide you and your 
          family better breakfasts that lead to better days, and we flake corn the same way W.K. Kellogg did 
          back in 1898. It just tastes better that way! <br><br>
  
          W.K. Kellogg founded our company through his belief in nutrition and dedication to well-being. 
          Motivated by a passion for people, quality and innovation, he created the first-ever breakfast cereal 
          and then shaped an entire industry. Kellogg soon became a household name; his signature, a trusted mark. 
          Today, his legacy continues to inspire us. Working together, we create moments of delight for people 
          around the world with our well-loved brands.</p>

          <span>Mission</span>
        </div>
        <p>A good and just world where people are not just fed but fulfilled envisions a society that 
          prioritizes the holistic well-being of its citizens. <br><br>

          The foundation of creating better days for everyone begins with ensuring access to nutritious food. 
          Trusted food brands have the resources and infrastructure to reach vast populations. By committing 
          to sustainable sourcing and ethical practices, these brands can ensure that high-quality, nutritious 
          food is available to all, particularly to those in underserved communities. Initiatives such as 
          subsidizing healthy options and partnering with local food banks can help bridge the gap between 
          abundance and scarcity.</p>
